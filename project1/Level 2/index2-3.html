		<h1><em>The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost</em></h1>
		<div><lu><li><strong>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry</strong></li></lu></div> 
		<div><a href="www.facebook.com"
		I could not travel both</div>
		<div>And be one traveler, long I stood</div>
		<div>And looked down one as far as I could</div>
		<div>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</div>
		</a>
		<div><lu><li><strong>Then took the other, as just as fair,</strong></li></lu></div>
		<div><a href="www.facebook.com"
		And having perhaps the better claim,</div>
		<div>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</div>
		<div>Though as for that the passing there</div>
		<div>Had worn them really about the same,</div>
		</a>
		<div><lu><li><strong>And both that morning equally lay</strong></li></lu></div>
		<div><a href="www.facebook.com"
		In leaves no step had trodden black.</div>
		<div>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</div>
		<div>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</div>
		<div>I doubted if I should ever come back.</div>
		</a>
		<div><lu><li><strong>I shall be telling this with a sigh</strong></li></lu></div>
		<div><a href="www.facebook.com"
		Somewhere ages and ages hence:</div>
		<div>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-</div>
		<div>I took the one less traveled by,</div>
		<div>And that has made all the difference.</div>
		</a>
