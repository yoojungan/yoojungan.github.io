		<h1><em>The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost</em></h1>
		<a href="www.facebook.com"
		<div><lu><li><strong>Two</strong> roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry</li></lu></div> 
		<ol>
		<li>
		I could not travel both
		<li>
		And be one traveler, long I stood
		<li>
		And looked down one as far as I could
		<li>
		To where it bent in the undergrowth;
		</li>
		</ol>
		<div><lu><li><strong>Then</strong> took the other, as just as fair,</li></lu></div>
		<ol>
		<li>
		And having perhaps the better claim,
		<li>
		Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
		<li>Though as for that the passing there
		<li>Had worn them really about the same,
		</li>
		</ol>
		<div><lu><li><strong>And</strong> both that morning equally lay</li></lu></div>
		<ol>
		<li>
		In leaves no step had trodden black.
		<li>Oh, I kept the first for another day!
		<li>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
		<li>I doubted if I should ever come back.
		</li>
		</ol>
		<div><lu><li><strong>I</strong> shall be telling this with a sigh</li></lu></div>
		<ol>
		<li>
		Somewhere ages and ages hence:
		<li>
		Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-
		<li>
		I took the one less traveled by,
		<li>
		And that has made all the difference.
		</li>
		</ol>
