		The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost<br/>
		<br/><br/>
&nbsp;Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>
&nbsp;And sorry I could not travel both<br/>
&nbsp;And be one traveler, long I stood<br/>
&nbsp;And looked down one as far as I could<br/>
&nbsp;To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
&nbsp;Then took the other, as just as fair,<br/>
&nbsp;And having perhaps the better claim,<br/>
&nbsp;Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br/>
&nbsp;Though as for that the passing there<br/>
&nbsp;Had worn them really about the same,<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
&nbsp;And both that morning equally lay<br/>
&nbsp;In leaves no step had trodden black.<br/>
&nbsp;Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br/>
&nbsp;Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br/>
&nbsp;I doubted if I should ever come back.<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
&nbsp;I shall be telling this with a sigh<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the one less traveled by,<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that has made all the difference.<br/>
