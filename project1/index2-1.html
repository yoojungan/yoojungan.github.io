		<h1>The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost</h1>
		<div> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</div>
		<div>And <em>sorry</em></div> 
		<div><strong>I</strong> could not travel both</div>
		<div>And be one traveler, long <strong>I</strong> stood</div>
		<div>And looked down one as far as <strong>I</strong> could</div>
		<div>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</div><div></div>
		<div>Then took the other, as just as fair,</div>
		<div>And having perhaps the better claim,</div>
		<div>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</div>
		<div>Though as for that the passing there</div>
		<div>Had worn them really about the same,</div>
		<div>And both that morning equally lay</div>
		<div>In leaves no step had trodden black.</div>
		<div>Oh, <strong>I</strong> kept the first for another day!</div>
		<div>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</div>
		<div><strong>I</strong> doubted if <strong>I</strong> should ever come back.</div>
		<div><strong>I</strong> shall be telling this with a sigh</div>
		<div>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</div>
		<div>Two roads diverged in a wood, and <strong>I</strong>-</div>
		</a>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span><strong>I</strong> took the one</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				less traveled by,
			</li>
		</ul>
